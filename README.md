# SMS Fraud Detector

This is a simple SMS viewing application.
There are some predefined numbers that are set in the DB for now.
When the user opens a chat with a number, that number is cross-checked in our database.
If the number is registered in our database, it will show what is the threat level for the said contact & whether it is safe to continue chatting with them or not.
